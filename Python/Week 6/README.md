# Welcome to Week 6 of LS Python!
This week we will be covering topics like Web Scraping and Web APIs. 

## Python APIs
Every website has an API or Application Programming Interface hosted on its web server, through which it distributes data avaliable on the web server. To use an API, you make a request to a remote web server, and retrieve the data you need. Retrieving data using APIs can be useful when the data on the web server is dynamic, that is, changing constantly, for example, stock price data. 
A good analogy for understanding APIs is that when you type in a URL, you request a webpage from the webserver, similarly, through an API you request data from the webserver. This data is returned in JSON format.

## Introduction to Web Scraping and Parsing
Web scraping is the process of accessing the HTML page of any website and then collecting data from that page. This is useful for many applications where you want data continously from websites in which data is dynamic, for instance, stock prices, or sports stats, or amazon product prices. Again, the idea is same as APIs, that is collect data from websites, but here instead of using the website's API for data, we use the HTML page of the website.

Now lets go deeper into web scraping and build our own parser. For navigating through a webpage to extract only the useful information, we use a famous Python Library known as **BeautifulSoup**. You can checkout the documentation **[here](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)**.

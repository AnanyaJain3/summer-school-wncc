# Machine Learning: Learner's Space

Hello everyone, welcome to the machine learning course offered by WnCC in association with Career Cell under Learner's Space. 

We will be covering the essential components of clasical machine learning before moving onto the basics of deep learning in this course. This course requires you to be comfortable with the basics of Python as a prerequisite. Follow the tutorials below to get started!

## Week 1
 
We begin our journey in the world of Machine Learning by laying down the foundation stone of various associated domains of Mathematics and Coding skills. 

* We start with **Python**, probably one of the most popular languages around the globe used in Machine Learning and programming at large. 
* We then head on to one of the most important skills of Machine Learning namely **Data Plotting and Visualisation**. It is one of the first steps to solve a machine learning challenge. Unless one is familiar with the data he/she will deal with is essential to developing a good Machine Learning model for the task. 
* We talk about **Data Distribution** which is central to understanding the kind of model that can be used to solve the problem at hand.
* Let us say, we know what data we want to deal with and know about it's distribution but we generally can't feed the data directly to our model and hence it is essential to **prepare** the data and **pre-process** it as per need of our model. So, we look at a really useful library called Pandas.
* Having prepared the data, now the question is, how to process it efficiently. Here creeps in **Numpy - Numerical Python**. One of the most extensively used libaries for computing and widely used to speed up the task at hand.
* We now try to acclimatise readers with Machine Learning foundations namely, **Calculus and Linear Algebra**.

We are now set to dive deep into Machine learning and every aspect of it in detail starting with week 2.
 
## Week 2

We begin our walk with basics of Machine Learning i.e. Regression and Classification in this week.

* **Linear Regression** is probably one of the most fundamental ideas in Machine Learning and in fact, Machine Learning build around Linear Regression.
* A more efficient model than simple Linear Regression finds it's way onto the middle often referred to as **Segmented Regression**. We talk about the relative performance of this model wrt Simple Linear Regression. 
* A really good Linear Regression model based on really good observations is **Locally Weighted Regression**, which we talk in detail about.
* From the world of linearity in regression model, we jump into **Logistic Regression for Classification of Data**.
* We talk about a relatively advanced model called **Naive Bayes Classifier** which was used extensively in Machine Learning era.
* We then try to build upon the Data Analysis we learned in Week 1 by understanding **Exploratory Data Analysis** and **Data Pre-Processing**.
* We finally try to unify all the types of linear models under one umbrella called **Generalised Linear Models (GLM)**. This topic turns to be math intensive and so we in some sense try to make it as much as intutive as possible and avoided the math behind stuff.
